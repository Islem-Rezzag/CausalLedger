## Active plan

`plans/active/CLP-0001-m00-repo-operating-system.md`

## Current submilestone

M00.03 Planning and Tracking System QA has passed and is awaiting PR merge on branch `m00-03-planning-and-tracking-system`.

M00.01 Roadmap and submilestone registry is completed and merged. M00.02 Active docs and repo guidance is completed and merged. M00.03 QA validation passed on 2026-05-06 after a scoped post-merge finalization guidance fix. M00.03 is not fully complete until the PR is merged.

## Product code status

No product code exists yet.

## Next action

Merge the M00.03 PR. Do not start M00.04 before the M00.03 PR is merged and post-merge finalization records M00.03 as `Completed and merged`.

## Implementation warning

Do not start product implementation. Continue M00 only through the active plan.

## Validation limitations

- `make bootstrap-check` could not be run on 2026-05-04 because `make` is not available in the current Windows shell.
- Equivalent underlying checks were run directly with Python:
  - `python scripts/validate-control-plane.py`
  - `python -m pytest tests/test_control_plane_bootstrap.py`
- `rg` failed to launch in this Windows shell with access denied during exploratory checks; PowerShell listing/search was used instead.
