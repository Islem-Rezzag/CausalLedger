# Start Here

M00–M04 are closed; V1_PUBLIC_PRODUCT remains approved. M05.01–M05.06 are Completed and merged, including verified human PR86. M05.07–M05.08 synthetic refund lifecycle is Builder complete, awaiting QA on codex/m05-refund-lifecycle under plans/active/CLP-0006-m05-provider-and-bank-simulator.md. Full/partial/multiple refund creation and paid evidence are implemented and builder-tested; independent QA, current CI, learning and human merge remain pending. M05.09–M05.19 and M06–M21 remain Not started/unbound.

Current versioning and release-scope references are `docs/VERSIONING.md`, `docs/releases/RELEASE_LADDER.md`, `docs/releases/V1_SCOPE.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`.

## First-run instructions for Codex

Read the active docs before making any changes. Treat this repository as file-first: project memory lives in the repo, not in prior chat context.

## Required read order

1. `docs/ACTIVE_DOCS.md`
2. `README.md`
3. `START_HERE.md`
4. `AGENTS.md`
5. `PLANS.md`
6. `WORKFLOW.md`
7. `docs/INDEX.md`
8. `plans/ROADMAP.md`
9. `docs/status/CURRENT_STATE.md`
10. `docs/status/NEXT_RECOMMENDED_THREAD.md`
11. Active plan in `plans/active/`, if one exists

## Active-plan rule

Detect active plans by listing `plans/active/` and reading any `CLP-*.md` file found there.

If an active plan exists, continue only that plan. Do not widen scope, start another milestone, or silently create competing plans. Read the active plan before editing and update it at every meaningful stopping point.

If no active plan exists, do not code. Create a CausalLedger Plan first, record the intended milestone or submilestone, and update status docs before implementation begins.

## Branch recovery

Every builder and QA thread must start with a branch guard:

- `git branch --show-current`
- `git status --short`
- `git remote -v`

If Codex is on the wrong branch, stop before editing. Report the current branch, expected branch, dirty files if any, and the safest recovery command for a human to run, such as `git switch <expected-branch>`. Do not create commits, move branches, or rewrite work to recover automatically unless the user explicitly asks.

Codex may stage, commit, or push scoped changes only when explicitly authorized. Codex must not merge PRs; humans merge after QA PASS and normal merge readiness checks.

## Recommended thread model

- one planning thread per milestone
- one builder thread per submilestone
- one QA thread per submilestone
- one closeout thread per milestone

Each submilestone uses the same branch and the same PR for its builder thread and QA thread. Open a draft PR before QA when possible. Merge only after QA records PASS.

Use `docs/ops/builder-qa-prompt-protocol.md`, `docs/ops/github-pr-and-issue-workflow.md`, `prompts/template_builder_submilestone.md`, `prompts/template_qa_submilestone.md`, and `prompts/template_handoff_packet.md` when preparing future builder, QA, PR, and handoff prompts.

## Review ritual after each slice

After every meaningful slice, update the active plan, `docs/status/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/status/WEEKLY_LOG.md`, `docs/status/NEXT_RECOMMENDED_THREAD.md`, and any relevant risk or tech-debt notes. Run validation and produce a handoff packet.

The handoff packet must include files created, files changed, files intentionally not touched, validation commands, validation result, completion status, product implementation status, remaining issues, and exact next recommended thread.

## What not to do first

- Do not implement product functionality outside the active submilestone.
- Do not extend MoneyEvent logic beyond the active source-neutral boundary.
- Keep current work inside the mapped M05.07–M05.08 synthetic refund unit in CLP0006. Payout86 and capture84 human merges are verified; the next unit waits for independent review/final CI, required learning and human merge. No financial authority is added.
- Do not implement invariants.
- Do not implement the agent runtime.
- Do not implement UI features.
- Do not close M03 or start M04 before M03.06 independent QA PASS, PR merge, and formal M03 milestone closeout.
- Do not implement product behavior during M01.01, M01.02, M01.03, or M01.04.

## Correct first success

The correct first success is that Codex can read the repo, understand current project state, and safely continue from active docs without chat memory.


Historical M05.03 capture snapshot (superseded by current refund state above): M00–M04 are closed; V1_PUBLIC_PRODUCT remains approved. M05.01 and M05.02 are Completed and merged in verified PR82/PR83. M05.03 Simulate payment captured is QA passed, awaiting merge for sole PR #84 on m05-03-simulate-payment-captured under plans/active/CLP-0006-m05-provider-and-bank-simulator.md. Synthetic capture composition is implemented; M05.04–M05.19 and M06–M21 remain Not started/unbound.


## M05.02 current checkpoint (2026-10-16)

M00–M04 are closed; V1_PUBLIC_PRODUCT remains approved. M05.01 is Completed and merged in verified human PR82. M05.02 Simulate payment authorized is QA passed, awaiting merge for sole PR #83 on m05-02-simulate-payment-authorized under plans/active/CLP-0006-m05-provider-and-bank-simulator.md. Only the synthetic authorization generator is implemented. Independent candidate acceptance passed; final tracking-head gates and human merge remain. M05.03–M05.19 and M06–M21 remain Not started/unbound.
