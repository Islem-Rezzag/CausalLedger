# CausalLedger

CausalLedger is a planned continuous payment lifecycle observability and incident-response system for fintech money movement. It is designed to build a living causal timeline from provider events, webhooks, ledger entries, settlement files, bank evidence, refunds, chargebacks, and provider failures so teams can find, prove, replay, and safely review repairs for money-movement breaks.

CausalLedger is not a bank, payment processor, ledger replacement, AML/KYC platform, fraud scoring engine, credit risk engine, tax or legal advisor, investment advisor, ERP replacement, treasury management system, or autonomous finance agent.

The LLM never owns financial truth. LLM agents may investigate, summarize, and propose. LLM agents may not mutate money, approve repairs, delete evidence, post ledger entries, modify raw events, or override deterministic invariants.

## One-line pitch

CausalLedger helps fintech teams prove, replay, and safely repair money-movement incidents without letting agents become financial truth.

## Current status

CausalLedger has completed M00 Repo Operating System and tagged it as `v0.1.0`. M01 Domain Model and Scope Freeze is completed and closed after M01.01 through M01.13 completed and merged. The completed M01 plan is `plans/completed/CLP-0002-m01-domain-model-and-scope-freeze.md`, and the closeout packet is `docs/status/M01_CLOSEOUT.md`. M01.13 QA Domain Consistency merged at git commit `27c39b6` (`docs: run M01.13 domain consistency QA (#35)`). M01.01, M01.05, and M01.10 required post-merge QA recovery after builder PRs merged before QA; those recoveries completed before later submilestones proceeded. Duplicate M01.12 PR merges #32 and #33 from the same branch are recorded as a process deviation with no revert performed. M02 Monorepo and Local Development Environment is in progress, with active plan `plans/active/CLP-0003-m02-monorepo-and-local-development-environment.md`. M02 planning PR #37 merged into `main` at commit `18148f7`; M02.01 Choose backend and frontend stack is `Completed and merged` after PR #38 merged into `main` at commit `fb2b901`; M02.02 Create apps/api is `Completed and merged` after PR #39 merged into `main` at commit `8ddf5da`; M02.03 Create apps/web is `QA passed, awaiting merge` for PR #40 on branch `m02-03-create-apps-web`; M02.04 through M02.20 remain `Not started`; product domain implementation has not started.

This repository currently contains architecture, planning, prompt, skill, milestone, status, GitHub template, versioning, validation scaffolding, workspace manifests, a minimal non-domain `apps/api` TypeScript/Fastify scaffold, and a minimal non-domain `apps/web` React/Vite scaffold. No product functionality, evidence ingestion runtime, evidence storage layer, MoneyEvent logic, ledger logic, invariants, incident engine, causal graph, replay engine, agent runtime, repair planner runtime, repair execution, product UI features, CausalLedger domain API routes, databases, GitHub Actions, CI workflows, deployment, auth/authz runtime, structured logging, monitoring, runtime security controls, secrets, or external connectors exist yet.

## What CausalLedger is

- A planned financial incident-response system.
- A planned continuous payment lifecycle observer.

- A planned benchmark foundation for agentic financial operations.

## What CausalLedger is not

- A payment processor.
- A ledger replacement.
- A generic reconciliation tool.
- A fraud platform.
- An AML platform.
- A KYC onboarding platform.
- A sanctions screening platform.
- A credit risk engine.
- A tax, legal, trading, or investment advisor.

- A source of financial truth through LLM output.

## Safety principle

The LLM never owns financial truth.

LLM agents may investigate incidents, summarize evidence, generate hypotheses, explain uncertainty, draft case memos, and propose repair plans. LLM agents may not mutate money, post ledger entries, approve repairs, delete evidence, modify raw events, override invariants, release external communications, or claim unsupported financial facts.

Financial truth comes from raw evidence, canonical money events, deterministic invariants, double-entry ledger checks, causal graph relationships, replay results, evidence bundles, and human approval.

## How to work with Codex

Start with `START_HERE.md`. Codex should read active docs in the required order, continue an existing active plan if one exists, and create a plan before coding if no active plan exists. Every builder and QA thread must run the branch guard before edits, stay on the same submilestone branch and PR, update the active plan and status files, run validation, use the GitHub PR workflow when opening or reviewing a PR, and produce a handoff packet. Codex may stage, commit, and push only when explicitly authorized, and must not merge PRs. Humans merge PRs after QA PASS and merge readiness checks. Do not start the next submilestone until QA has passed and the PR has merged.

## Milestone overview

See `plans/ROADMAP.md` and `docs/milestones/SUBMILESTONE_REGISTRY.md` for the canonical detailed milestone and submilestone structure.

## First success condition

Codex understands the repo and can continue from active docs without relying on chat memory.
